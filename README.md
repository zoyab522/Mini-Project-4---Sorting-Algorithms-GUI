# Mini-Project-4---Sorting-Algorithms-GUI

This is a Simple JavaFX Maven Archetype Project (Gluon). 

This Mini Project was a group project (Zoya Bawangaonwala and Anika Suman). 
All of our code is documented as necessary. 

Issues: 
Two of our tabs (Insertion Sort and Selection Sort) have a slight issue -- they don't always completely sort the the input. 
This is a minor issue we are working to fix -- everything else works well. 

Tab Descriptions: 
With Insertion and Selection Sort, there are more visual aids in seeing the sorting process (blocks are yellow as each step is performed, 
and when the sorting is complete, they are all green).

For Merge Sort and Quick Sort, those tabs work a bit differently. All you need to do is click on 'Start Sort' and the input is sorted. The steps
are printed below the fields in a label that updates constantly. 

Files: 
As for the application.css file, it is simply for displaying fonts properly. It goes in the target > classes folder of the project. 
The mp.png image goes in the src > main folder of the project. 

Contributions:

Anika added functionality to the buttons (for example, generating the random numbers and clearing the fields). 
She also added the green/yellow visual aids for sorting in the insertion and selection sort tabs. 
She also wrote the algorithms for sorting for those tabs/implemented them accordingly and added the image on the Sorting Intro tab.
Zoya wrote the sorting algorithms for the merge and quick sort tabs and had them display the steps in the labels below the fields. Zoya created the 
Pane, tabs, fields, buttons, labels, and other visual elements of the GUI. Finally, Zoya also commented out most of the code as it was needed.
